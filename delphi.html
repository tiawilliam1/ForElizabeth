                    <h2>The Oracle of Delphi</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Journey into the heart of ancient Greece with a visit to the <strong>oracle of Delphi</strong>, once considered the very navel of the world. 
                        Nestled on the slopes of <strong>Mount Parnassus</strong>, this <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong> offers a powerful blend of natural beauty and mythological richness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In antiquity, pilgrims from across the Greek world traveled here to seek guidance from <strong>Apollo</strong>, god of music and poetry, 
                        who was believed to channel prophetic words through the high priestess <strong>Pythia</strong>. 
                        Even today, the site retains its aura of mystery and spiritual significance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you explore the archaeological site, you’ll encounter iconic landmarks such as the <strong>Athenian Treasury</strong>, the <strong>Temple of Apollo</strong>, 
                        the ancient theater, the Roman stadium, the polygonal wall, the <strong>Portico of the Athenians</strong>, and the <strong>Temple of Athena Pronaia</strong>. 
                        The tour continues at the <strong>Delphi Archaeological Museum</strong>, which houses an extraordinary collection of artifacts unearthed from the site. 
                        Highlights include the renowned bronze <strong>Charioteer of Delphi</strong>—a masterpiece of classical sculpture—and the exquisite gold and ivory statues of <strong>Apollo</strong> and his sister <strong>Artemis</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following the visit, enjoy a leisurely lunch in the picturesque village of <strong>Delphi</strong>, where traditional Greek flavors and mountain views create a memorable dining experience. 
                        On the way back, we’ll make a short stop in the charming village of <strong>Arachova</strong>—famous for its stone-built houses and colorful textiles—perfect for a few photos and a taste of local life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you’re drawn by history, mythology, or the sheer beauty of the setting, a visit to <strong>Delphi</strong> promises an unforgettable encounter with the soul of classical Greece.
