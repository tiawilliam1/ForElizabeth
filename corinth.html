                    <h2>Corinth & the Canal: A Day Tour Through Trade, Power & Philosophy</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        This full-day tour offers a rich journey through one of ancient Greece’s most influential city-states, combining history, culture, and authentic local flavors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tour begins at <strong>the Corinth Canal</strong>, a narrow artificial waterway that links the <strong>Aegean Sea</strong> to the <strong>Ionian Sea</strong> through the <strong>Isthmus of Corinth</strong>. 
                        Although completed in the 19th century, the idea of cutting through this land bridge was first considered in antiquity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The journey continues to <strong>Ancient Corinth</strong>, one of the most important city-states of antiquity. 
                        Located at a key junction between northern and southern Greece, Corinth was known for its wealth, commerce, and cultural influence. 
                        The archaeological site includes the <strong>Temple of Apollo</strong>, a rare surviving example of Archaic Doric architecture, and the <strong>Roman Forum</strong>, 
                        where administrative and commercial life once took place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visitors will also encounter the <strong>Bema</strong>, the public platform from which the Apostle Paul addressed the citizens of Corinth in the first century CE—an event that established the city’s enduring role in early Christian history. 
                        The <strong>Archaeological Museum of Corinth</strong> houses a collection of artifacts, including mosaics, sculptures, and everyday objects, offering a detailed view of the city’s development from the Greek to the Roman era.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To complete the experience, indulge in an authentic olive oil tasting session. Sample some of Greece’s finest extra virgin olive oils, celebrated worldwide for their rich flavors and health benefits. 
                        Learn about the centuries-old tradition of olive cultivation in the region, and discover how olive oil has shaped the local culture and cuisine from ancient times to today.
