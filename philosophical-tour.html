                    <h2>Philosophical Walking Tour of Athens: From Presocratics to Diogenes</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        We begin on <strong>Philopappos Hill</strong>, also known as <strong>the Hill of the Muses</strong>. 
                        With wide views over Athens and the sea, it’s the perfect place to consider how philosophy began. 
                        Here we recall the <strong>Presocratic thinkers</strong>—like <strong>Thales</strong>, who believed everything comes from water, 
                        and <strong>Heraclitus</strong>, who saw all things in constant change. 
                        These early philosophers searched for the hidden principles behind nature, using reason rather than myth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here, we turn to <strong>Socrates</strong>, who shifted philosophy inward, from the cosmos to the soul. 
                        He was sentenced to death for corrupting the youth and questioning the gods, but he accepted the verdict calmly, 
                        choosing to die rather than abandon his pursuit of truth. 
                        We visit the site known as <strong>the Prison of Socrates</strong>, where we reflect on his final days. 
                        Then we climb <strong>Pnyka Hill</strong>, the birthplace of democracy, where citizens once gathered to speak and vote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the quiet of <strong>Kerameikos Cemetery</strong>, we consider the teachings of <strong>Plato</strong> and <strong>Aristotle</strong>. 
                        <strong>Plato</strong> believed our souls belong to a world of eternal <strong>Forms</strong>—pure and perfect truths behind everything we see. 
                        <strong>Aristotle</strong>, more practical, believed virtue is found through reason and purposeful action in daily life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We continue to <strong>the Ancient Agora</strong>, the old center of public life. 
                        Among its ruins is the site of <strong>the Painted Stoa</strong>, where <strong>Zeno of Citium</strong> founded the Stoic school. 
                        The <strong>Stoics</strong> taught that peace of mind comes from accepting what we cannot control and living with wisdom, courage, and self-discipline—even in the middle of the city’s chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We end at <strong>the Square of Diogenes</strong>. 
                        <strong>Diogenes the Cynic</strong> was the boldest of them all. He lived simply—some say in a barrel—and challenged society by example. 
                        With biting wit and radical honesty, he showed that true freedom means needing nothing and fearing no one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This walk through Athens is more than a journey through ruins—it’s an invitation to <strong>think differently</strong>, 
                        to <strong>question deeply</strong>, and to <strong>live more wisely</strong>.
                    </p>
