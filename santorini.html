                    <p>
                        Start your day in <strong>Oia</strong>, Santorini’s most iconic village, perched on the island’s northern tip. 
                        Wander through narrow alleys lined with whitewashed houses, blue-domed churches, and boutique shops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Continue south to the archaeological site of <strong>Akrotiri</strong>, a well-preserved Bronze Age settlement often referred to as the <strong>Pompeii of the Aegean</strong>. 
                        Buried under volcanic ash after the 17th-century BCE eruption, the site reveals multi-story buildings, frescoes, pottery, and evidence of an advanced civilization that once thrived on Santorini.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From <strong>Akrotiri</strong>, head to the island’s capital, <strong>Fira</strong>, to visit the <strong>Museum of Prehistoric Thira</strong>. 
                        The museum displays important artifacts recovered from Akrotiri, including vivid frescoes, tools, ceramics, and religious objects. 
                        After exploring the museum, take a short walk through Fira’s bustling center, where you’ll find shops, viewpoints, and traditional tavernas. 
                        It’s a good place to enjoy lunch with a view before continuing your tour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the afternoon, visit a local winery for a guided tasting experience. 
                        Santorini’s volcanic soil and dry climate produce distinctive wines, especially the crisp <strong>Assyrtiko</strong> and the traditional sweet <strong>Vinsanto</strong>. 
                        At the winery, learn about local grape varieties, see how the vines are cultivated in low basket shapes to resist the wind, and sample a selection of wines paired with local snacks or cheeses. 
                        Many wineries are located on scenic estates with views of the caldera or the island’s interior.
