                    <h2>Spetses</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Begin your day with a scenic ferry ride from the harbor of <strong>Piraeus</strong>, gliding over the sparkling <strong>Saronic Gulf</strong> to reach the island of <strong>Spetses</strong>. 
                        The car-free harbor immediately sets the tone: elegant, serene, and steeped in history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your first stop is <strong>Dapia</strong>, the central port and social heart of the island. 
                        Lined with cafés and boutique shops housed in 19th-century buildings, it offers sweeping sea views and a stylish introduction to the island. 
                        Stroll along the promenade, where historic cannons stand in silent tribute to <strong>Spetses’</strong> role in the <strong>Greek War of Independence</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our tour begins with a visit to the <strong>Bouboulina Museum</strong>, located in the 300-year-old mansion of the legendary heroine. 
                        Her fascinating story as a naval commander during the <strong>Greek War of Independence</strong> stands as a remarkable example of bravery and self-sacrifice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, we’ll visit the <strong>House of Hatzigiannis Mexis</strong>, another historic mansion now functioning as a <strong>National Historical Museum</strong>. 
                        Through its collection of manuscripts, weapons, and ship models, you'll gain insight into life on the island during the 19th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then continue to the <strong>Monastery of Agios Nikolaos</strong>, the spiritual heart of <strong>Spetses</strong> and the site where the revolutionary flag was first raised in 1821.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After our visits, enjoy a leisurely lunch at one of the waterfront tavernas in the old harbor area of <strong>Palio Limani</strong>, where traditional wooden <strong>kaikia</strong> (fishing boats) bob beside sleek modern yachts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will conclude our day with a walk around the lighthouse of the old port, where you can admire the park of bronze statues created by contemporary artist <strong>Natalia Mela</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step into a world without cars, where donkeys and footpaths lead you through cobbled lanes, and sea captains’ mansions whisper tales of revolution and refinement. 
                        <strong>Spetses</strong> offers a full-day escape filled with understated elegance, maritime heritage, and artistic charm—all set against the deep blue of the Aegean.
